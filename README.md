# Python-Project-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It allows two players to play the game on a command-line interface. The game features a board representation, player input validation, turn handling, win checking, and the option to play again.

## How to Play
Run the Python script to start the game.
Each player will be prompted to choose their marker: 'X' or 'O'.
The players take turns entering their positions on the board, using numbers from 1 to 9 (corresponding to the board's cells).
The game will display the board after each move and check for a winner or a draw.
If a player wins, the game will display a victory message and prompt to play again.
If the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed, and the players can choose to play again.

## Features
Board representation: The game uses a visual representation of the board, making it easy to see the state of the game at each turn.
Player input validation: Players are guided to enter valid markers and positions, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.
Turn handling: The game alternates turns between players, allowing each player to make their move.
Win checking: The game checks for winning combinations after each move to determine if a player has won.
Draw detection: If the board is full and no player has won, the game detects a draw.
Replay option: After each game, players have the option to play again, ensuring continuous gameplay.
